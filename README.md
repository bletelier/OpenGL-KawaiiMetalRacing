# Kawaii Metal Racing
## Created using OpenGL in the Computer Graphics course at Civil Informatics Engineering (UACh)

This is a 2-player game based on Rock N' Roll Racing, but instead of Rock N' Roll we used Kawaii Metal songs!

The idea is to win the race (reaching the goal) while each player try to sabotage the other. This can be done throwing ninja stars or putting slowing traps on the road.
