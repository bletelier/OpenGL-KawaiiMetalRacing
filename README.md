# Kawaii Metal Racing
## Created using OpenGL in the Computer Graphics course at Civil Informatics Engineering (UACh)

This is a 2-player game based on Rock N' Roll Racing, but instead of Rock N' Roll we used Kawaii Metal songs!

The idea is to win the race (reaching the goal) both players try to sabotage the other, throwing ninja stars or putting traps on the road.
